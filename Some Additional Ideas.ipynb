    "1. There is a daily record of deaths and weather in some of the old health reports; for example, here in the [1872 report (at the back)](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc2.ark:/13960/t8df7fg0h&seq=382&view=1up). It might be an interesting time series project to fit a model to this and see where that goes.\n",
    "2. There is also an interesting meningitis map in the same source.\n",
    "3. To reiterate - there are a lot of tables and data that show mortality by day, with pretty intense weather observations, with reference to different diseases.\n",
    "4. There are ward-level disease deaths from Zymotic disease by quarter."
